					<h3>Hi! I'm Jo *waves*</h3>
					<h3 class="fragment">I'm not a developer</h3>
					<h3 class="fragment"/>and I'm entirely new to #devrel</h3>
					<h3 class="fragment"/>but I'm here to talk to you about a problem with open source projects</h3>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Step One: Acknowledge the Problem</h2>
				</section>

				<section>

					<h3>Projects are dying!</h3>
					<img src="./images/chart1.png" alt="piechart" height="300"/>
					
					<blockquote>64% of the most active projects on GitHub rely on 1 or 2 developers to survive<footer>Roads and Bridges: The Unseen Labor Behind Our Digital Infrastructure</footer></blockquote>
					<aside class="notes">Let's start from the premise that many vital projects are run by a very small team of developers, who often have day jobs and are doing this in their spare time</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>and they are not very diverse!</h3>
					<img src="./images/chart2.png" alt="piechart" height="300"/>
					<blockquote>The ratio of women in IT is about 17-25%... but in open source [it's] around 0.1-5%<footer>Sustainable Open Source, Jan Lehnhardt</footer></blockquote>
					<aside class="notes">Obvs this is just one diversity metric but at the very least this means there's a pool of talent that can be mined for participation in projects</aside>
				</section>


				<section data-background-image="./images/barrier.jpg" alt="fence" class="full" data-background-size="cover" data-background-color="white">
					<h3 style="color:black">Documentation is severely lacking!</h3>
					<div class="box-left">
					<blockquote>Lack of documentation is a highly effective barrier to participation... adoption and contribution
						<footer>Riona MacNamara at Write the Docs Australia 2019 (via @knowledge_owl)</footer>
					</blockquote>
				</div>
				<small class="attribution" style="color:black">image via <a href="http://www.peakpx.com">Peakpx</a>, CC0</small>
				</section>
				

				<section data-background-image="./images/facepalm.jpg" alt="bear" class="full" data-background-size="cover" data-background-color="white">
					<h3 style="color:black">and you get people saying this:</h3>
					<div class="box-right">
					<blockquote style="color:white">My code is open source on GitHub, but I don't spend any effort making it easy for others to use it. If you want to figure it out yourself, have fun!<footer>Redacted to protect the innocent</footer></blockquote>
					</div>
					<aside class="notes">Having a wilfully bad onboarding process for your project is not a badge of honour</aside>
					<small class="attribution" style="color:white">Bradley Howington, Pexels</small>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Yet getting help is tricky:</h3>
					<img src="./images/chart3.png" alt="piechart" height="300"/>
					<blockquote>Incomplete or outdated documentation is a pervasive problem, observed by 93% of respondents, yet 60% of contributors say they rarely or never contribute to documentation<footer>Github Open source survey 2017</footer></blockquote>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Step Two: Restate the problem</h2>
					<h3 class="fragment">Open source projects are under-resourced, not well-documented, and don't attract diverse contributions</h3>
				</section>


				<section>
					<h2>Step Three: Consider possible solutions</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Find more resources</h3>
					<blockquote>Long-term support is more about creating time than it is about money<footer>Roads and Bridges: The Unseen Labor Behind Our Digital Infrastructure</footer></blockquote>
				<aside class="notes">Open source is not inherently flawed, but rather under-resourced (from same report)</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Particularly for documentation</h3>
					<blockquote>Documentation is highly valued, frequently overlooked, and a means for establishing inclusive and accessible communities.<footer>Github Open Source Survey 2017 https://opensourcesurvey.org</footer></blockquote>
					<aside class="notes">Expanding the pool of contributors and encouraging contributions to more than just code makes a project more resilient</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>=> Encouraging user contributions is really important</h2>
					<h3 class="fragment">and here are some more reasons why...</h3>
					<aside class="notes">Not the impolite, entitled, frequently rude ones</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Developers might miss out steps</h3>
					<img src="./images/draw_the_owl.png" alt="owl" height="300"/>
					<blockquote>Step 2: Draw the rest of the *** owl<footer>Internet legend, 2008?</footer></blockquote>
					<aside class="notes">It's easy for people close to the software at its most technical level to miss out steps in quick start guides and how-tos. At a workshop for a mapping library recently, I think 20% of the participants would have given up during the setup stage were it not for the assistants helping out</aside>

				<section data-background-image="./images/confused.jpg" alt="pug" class="full" data-background-size="cover" data-background-color="white">
					<div class="fragment boxed fade-left">
						<h3 style="color:white">Developers are familiar with more technical terminologies</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="fragment boxed fade-left">
						<blockquote>Just clone the dev branch, add the grunt tasks and recompile...<footer>Slightly made up example</footer></blockquote>
					</div>
					<aside class="notes">Developers may use overly technical language or phrasing. A Nielsen Norman Group survey concluded that only 5% of the population of 33 rich countries has high computer-related abilities and only a third can complete medium complexity tasks https://www.nngroup.com/articles/computer-skill-levels/</aside>

				<section>
					<h3>Users know what users expectations and needs are</h3>
					<p>How are people actually using your project? Is it the way you expected them to?</p>
					<aside class="notes">As projects become more successful they gain a life of their own. Users become more demanding, but also help to establish what's important, find novel use-cases, and what needs more documentation love</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Users will actually want to use your documentation</h3>
					<blockquote>The current state of ***'s software is the worst I've ever seen for any framework anywhere...I've repeatedly been reduced to searching through WWDC video transcripts to figure out where someone says something relevant to whatever I'm working on<footer>Slashdot, October 2019</footer></blockquote>
					<aside class="notes">Are your docs fit for purpose? Are all the terms searchable (screenshots are bad for this), is it useable by people with different needs and abilities? PS it's not just about open source!</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Step Four: Figure out what puts people off</h2>
				</section>

				<section data-background-image="./images/barrier.jpg" alt="barrier" class="full" data-background-size="cover" data-background-color="white">
					<div class="fragment boxed fade-left">

				<section>
						<h3>A standard docs toolchain:</h3>
						<p class="fragment bold">Install the correct versions of java, python, maven, sphinx, sphinx-bootstrap-theme</p>
						<p class="fragment bold">Become a ReStructured Text ninja</p>
						<p class="fragment bold">Understand about GitHub Forks, Pull Requests, Reviews, and Commits</p>
						<p class="fragment bold">Then you can submit your first documentation change!</p>
					<aside class="notes">It may be a learning curve for a contributor to learn how to submit a pull request, or learn reStructuredText syntax before they actually get to contribute, so ensure you provide instructions or links to guidance as well. Getting documentation and git toolchains set up on windows can be a nightmare even for technically proficient users</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>This applies to software in general these days</h3>
					<blockquote>if you want to start building a full-stack web application in 2018, you may need to first install Node.js and the npm package manager, run a slew of npm commands to configure a custom toolchain with a CSS preprocessor and a JavaScript code bundler, adjust OS environment variables to detect all required library dependencies...<footer>Using Operating-System-Wide Activity Tracing, Alok Mysore and Philip J. Guo</footer></blockquote>
					<aside class="notes">You're assuming people actually want to use your software as an end in it's own right, when it may just be a step towards achieving an entirely separate objective. Users will ensure your documentation gets people through these early painful setup stages</aside>
				</section>

					<h3 style="color:white">New contributors feel unwelcome</h3>
