					<h3>Confession: I'm not a coder</h3>
					<h3 class="fragment"/>but I do like to solve problems</h3>
					<h3 class="fragment"/>and there's a problem with open source projects</h3>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Projects are dying!</h3>
					<blockquote>64% of the most active projects on GitHub rely on 1 or 2 developers to survive<footer>Roads and Bridges: The Unseen Labor Behind Our Digital Infrastructure</footer></blockquote>
					<aside class="notes">Let's start from the premise that many vital projects are run by a very small team of developers, who often have day jobs and are doing this in their spare time</aside>
				</section>


				<section>
					<h3>And:</h3>
					<blockquote>Lack of documentation is a highly effective barrier to participation... adoption and contribution
						<footer>Riona MacNamara at Write the Docs Australia 2019 (via @knowledge_owl)</footer>
					</blockquote>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Similarly:</h3>
					<blockquote>Incomplete or outdated documentation is a pervasive problem, observed by 93% of respondents, yet 60% of contributors say they rarely or never contribute to documentation<footer>Github Open source survey 2017</footer></blockquote>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>And:</h3>
					<blockquote>The ratio of women IT is about 17-25%... but in open source [it's] around 0.1-5%<footer>Sustainable Open Source, Jan Lehnhardt</footer></blockquote>
					<aside class="notes">At the very least this means there's a pool of talent that can be mined for participation in projects</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>And:</h3>
					<blockquote>My code is open source on GitHub, but I don't spend any effort making it easy for others to use it. If you want to figure it out yourself, have fun!<footer>Redacted to protect the innocent</footer></blockquote>
					<aside class="notes">Having a wilfully bad onboarding process for your project is not a badge of honour</aside>
				</section>


				<section>
					<h3>I'm here to make you a proposition:</h3>
					<h3 class="fragment bold">You can build a more sustainable ecosystem around your project</h3>
					<h3 class="fragment bold">by encouraging users to contribute documentation</h3>
				</section>

				<section>
					<blockquote>Long-term support is more about creating time than it is about money<footer>Roads and Bridges: The Unseen Labor Behind Our Digital Infrastructure</footer></blockquote>
				<aside class="notes">Open source is not inherently flawed, but rather under-resourced (from same report)</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>And:</h3>
					<blockquote>Documentation is highly valued, frequently overlooked, and a means for establishing inclusive and accessible communities.<footer>Github Open Source Survey 2017 https://opensourcesurvey.org</footer></blockquote>
					<aside class="notes">Expanding the pool of contributors and encouraging contributions to more than just code makes a project more resilient</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-state='sparkley'>
					<h3>Encouraging help with documentation for your project <bold class="fragment sparkley">encourages empathy</bold>, and <bold class="fragment sparkley">improves diversity</bold></h3>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Why users (*) make the best documenters</h3>
					<p class="fragment">* not the impolite, entitled, frequently rude ones</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Developers miss steps out</h3>
					<blockquote>Step 2: Draw the rest of the f***ing owl<footer>Internet legend</footer></blockquote>
					<aside class="notes">It's easy for people close to the software at it's most technical level to miss out steps in quick start guides and how-tos. At a workshop for a mapping library recently, I think 20% of the participants would have given up during the setup stage were it not for the assistants helping out</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Developers are familiar with more technical terminologies</h3>
					<blockquote>Just clone the dev branch, add the grunt tasks and recompile...<footer>Slightly made up example</footer></blockquote>
					<aside class="notes">Developers may use overly technical language or phrasing. A Nielsen Norman Group survey concluded that only 5% of the population of 33 rich countries has high computer-related abilities and only a third can complete medium complexity tasks https://www.nngroup.com/articles/computer-skill-levels/</aside>

				<section>
					<blockquote>if you want to start building a full-stack web application in 2018, you may need to first install Node.js and the npm package manager, run a slew of npm commands to configure a custom toolchain with a CSS preprocessor and a JavaScript code bundler, adjust OS environment variables to detect all required library dependencies<footer>Using Operating-System-Wide Activity Tracing, Alok Mysore and Philip J. Guo</footer></blockquote>
					<aside class="notes">You're assuming people actually want to use your software as an end in it's own right, when it may just be a step towards achieving an entirely separate objective. Users will ensure your documentation gets people through these early painful setup stages</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Users know what users expectations and needs are</h3>
					<aside class="notes">As projects become more successful they gain a life of their own. Users become more demanding, but also help to establish what's important, find novel use-cases, and what needs more documentation love</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Users will actually want to use your documentation</h3>
					<aside class="notes">Are all the terms searchable (screenshots are bad for this), is it useable by people with different needs and abilities?</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>How to put people off</h2>
					<p class="fragment">(like that guy, a few slides ago)</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Set high barriers to entry</h3>
					<p>Don't make it hard to contribute</p>
					<aside class="notes">It may be a learning curve for a contributor to learn how to submit a pull request or learn reStructuredText syntax before they actually get to contribute, so ensure you provide instructions or links to guidance as well</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Use off-putting language in existing documentation</h3>
					<h3>Avoid terms like <span class="fragment sad">just</span>, <span class="fragment sad">simply</span>, and <span class="fragment sad">easy</span></h3>
					<aside class="notes">https://twitter.com/JessTelford/status/992756386160234497</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Make new contributors feel unwelcome</h3>
					<blockquote>Negative experiences have real consequences for project health. 21% of people who experienced or witnessed a negative behavior said they stopped contributing to a project because of it<footer>Github Open Source Survey 2017</footer></blockquote>
					<aside class="notes">Contributors are not an annoyance, or an increased burden, or suitable only for minor tasks https://opensource.com/business/16/6/bad-practice-foss-projects-management</aside>
